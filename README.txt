This is a movie watchlist that allows you to add movies, mark them as watched,
and leave a review and rating. You can also view a movie's details by clicking in its title. 

This program uses an API from TMDB to fetch just about every movie out there and their details.
I think the results I got from using the API are pretty neat. 

Before running, enter this "move Movie-Watchlist-Main\* ." and this "rmdir Movie-Watchlist-Main" into the terminal.
To run, make sure node.js is installed and install other dependencies with "npm install".
Start the server with "npm start" and enter "http://localhost:3000" into your browswer address bar. 
Kill the program with "npx kill-port 3000".
